    <li>Whenever we work with promise, we do two things, first we produce a promise and second we consume the promise. when we consume nested "then" method, it may more complex, to reduce that complexity we use "async/await" concept. </li>
    <li>when we add "async" word before function it means this function must have to return a promise, not the value.</li>
    <li>Async/Await doesn't help in promise production, it help us with promise cunsumption.</li>
