    <li>Functional programming is a programming paradigm, it is design pattern.</li>
    <li>One of the most famous programming paradigm is object oriented programming.</li>
    <li>In javascript functionaly programming we try to achieve as much as oops concept like inheritance, data hiding, abstraction, singleton etc.</li>
    <li>JavaScript is a multi-paradigm language, which means that we can easily mix a lot of different paradigms inside a simple piece of JavaScript code. We can use object-oriented, procedural and functional programming paradigms all at the same time in JavaScript. The fact that JavaScript is multi-paradigm and allows us to work with a lot of different ways of programming is what makes this language so beautiful and powerful.</li>
    <li>Functional programming has a few important concepts that we need to know and understand. By implementing these concepts in your applications, we will end up with more functional code. This will make our application, more readable, usable, manageable, easy to test and bug-free.</li>
