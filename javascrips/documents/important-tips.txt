What are Declarative and Imperative Programming?

there are different ways of joining multiple words into one variable name:
Hyphens: first-name, last-name, master-card, inter-city , Hyphens are not allowed in JavaScript. It is reserved for subtractions.
Underscore: first_name, last_name, master_card, inter_city.
camelCase : camel case have two types : 
Upper Camel Case (Pascal Case): FirstName, LastName, MasterCard, InterCity. this id also known as pascal case.
Lower Camel Case: JavaScript programmers tend to use camel case that starts with a lowercase letter: firstName, lastName, masterCard, interCity. camelCase is used by JavaScript itself, by jQuery, and other JavaScript libraries.

JavaScript ignores multiple spaces. You can add white space to your script to make it more readable.
The following lines are equivalent:
var person = "Hege";
var person="Hege";
A good practice is to put spaces around operators ( = + - * / ):
var x = y + z;
