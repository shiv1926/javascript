A computer program is a list of "instructions" to be "executed" by the computer.
In a programming language, these program instructions are called statements.
instructions ( statements ) are executed line by line, in the same order as they are written.

JavaScript statements are separated by semicolons

Every statements are composed of:
Values, Operators, Expressions, Keywords, and Comments.

The JavaScript syntax defines two types of values: Fixed values and variable values.
Fixed values are called literals. Variable values are called variables.

JavaScript Identifiers
All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume).
The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are:
Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
Names must begin with a letter
Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial)
Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables)
Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names
JavaScript identifiers are case-sensitive.
